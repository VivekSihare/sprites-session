  - In the on start block:
  - From Sprites → drag set mySprite to sprite of kind Player
  - Click the grey box to draw a simple character (e.g., smiley face or stick figure)

  - From Scene: Drag set background color → pick a bright color (e.g., blue or green)
  - From Sprites: Drag set mySprite position to x: 80 y: 60
  - Say: “The screen is a grid. X moves left to right, Y moves up and down. This puts our player in the center.”
